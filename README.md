#LiveAPI ~ frontend

LiveAPI is an app created to examine if API's are running successfully or if the API's are currently redundant. 

The general idea of the app was generated by the team discussing issues we have been through throughout the bootcamp and what we can do to resolve it. 

Users can also add an API, delete an API, recieve links to the DOCS and also recieve data in a JSON file.


## Tech Stack 
What we used on the frontend consisted of:
```
React
Css
```


## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
By doing this, users can have access to fully maximise the app itself



## API Interface


Request    | Request body| Response status| Response body


|GET /apis/|   none	      |     200	   |{ success: true, payload: an array of api objects}


|POST /apis/|	{ api_name, api_url, tags, doclink }|	201  |    { success: true, payload: newly created api object }
